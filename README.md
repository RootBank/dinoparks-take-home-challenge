# Root - Dinoparks Take-home challenge

## Introduction

This is an open-sourced version of Root’s original developer take-home challenge. The intention behind this repo is to create more transparency into our hiring process and to enable the developer community to give feedback for improvement.

Read more about [Root’s culture](https://root.co.za/careers) and our [hiring process](https://www.offerzen.com/companies/root).

If you’re doing this challenge outside of our hiring process, please let us know what you’ve come up with by sharing your workings and feedback here.

## Measuring candidates

At Root, we follow a scorecard approach when hiring for any new role in the company, a concept based on the book [Who](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4989687-who). Our scorecards consist of four components: Mission, Outcomes, Competencies, and Background. The technical take-home challenge for developers is primarily focussed on testing a candidate's competencies and general approach to technical problem-solving.

These competencies allow us to measure, to some extent, how well a candidate will fit into and thrive in the Root engineering team. Some of the things we look for include:

- Experience in languages such as Javascript (Node), Go, Ruby or Python.  
- Experience with front-end frameworks such as React, Angular or Vue.  
- Experience with back-end tech like SQL and networking.  
- Experience with HTTP, asynchronous request handling, and AJAX.  
- Code quality, code structuring, and attention to detail.  

The challenge also gives us useful insight into a candidate’s ability to identify and define technical problems clearly, create effective solutions, and to rapidly prototype and test a solution (without over-engineering).

## The challenge itself

![Draw the Owl](/draw-the-owl.png?raw=true)

We strive to create a relevant, yet fun, challenge that allows candidates to learn and improve their skills whilst completing it. A way to get it as close to working at Root as possible, where you’re faced with data, some ideas, and then need to go [draw the owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GndXHY8J7Jo).

The challenge is presented to candidates in PDF format (see it here), and the results sent back in ZIP format – which includes the code workings and a readme to explain their thinking.
